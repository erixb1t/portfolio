                I'm born in 90s, first computer got when I was 12, but till then I spend a lot of time in computer
                classroom at school.
                Like it was yesterday I remember teacher shouting that it’ s enough sitting you must go, bus is waiting
                or you will be late, no one will wait longer for me.
                Sometimes I was ready to go about 5km to my home, so I just could spend one more hour by PC, in that
                time I was playing with Windows 95.
                Years later, I studied Computer system and network administration, but got job as a Land surveyor and IT
                administrators assistant I worked for 3 years.
                Five years ago I found myself that I want to be cook, from hobby to real deal. Got there very fast, as I
                am target driven personality, after one year I was first line cook.
                Worked Latvia’s best restaurants, such as “Vincents” and “Ferma”, later went to Austria’s Alps to learn
                its cuisine. Came back as Covid came, gave me time to consider, how I really want to help people.
                Now I am fully into tech, dusting of sharpening my early knowledge and learning new skills, I am diving
                back to IT to create something what world needs.

                <p>After successful 5 years in kitchen, I have pointed another direction towards programming and new
                    technologies. My passion about IT was never gone, it was just waiting for right moment to come up
                    and shine. Now I am about to change my career and life.
                    Along the way I have grown as personality through many fails and wins, but that’s the purpose of
                    learning and growing. I have learned how to stay focused and maintain calmness in stressful
                    situations, where everyone is shouting around me. I have learned how to never give up, because you
                    just can’t. Things must be done, no meter what, burnt or cut yourself. Bleeding or sweaty after 20
                    hours of work you must get back to line after 2 hours of sleep. I know what is like to work with
                    team and as an individual, how to find best way to sell product and finally how to prepare best
                    quality products.
                    Right now I am just beginner in field of programming, but I am target driven personality. I am very
                    excited when I see how things get done, how many things I still must learn to even start compete in
                    this field. So far I have completed 80h course of programming basics, where I have learned Java, C#,
                    JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS and what its take to even call yourself a programmer.
